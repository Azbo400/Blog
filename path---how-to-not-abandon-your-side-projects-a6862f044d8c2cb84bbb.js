Instead of finishing it later, I start working on a new project and hundreds of empty unfinished projects folder sit on my computer on my documents directory. </p>\n<p>I think most programmers can relate to this, hundreds of project folders that simply remain empty sitting there just abandoned completely.</p>\n<p>In this blog post I want to focus on \"How to <strong>not</strong> abandon all your side projects\"</p>\n<h4>#1 No passion for the project</h4>\n<p>From personal expierence and looking back on all my failed projects I feel like this is the number 1 reason why I stop working on projects: I never have any passion for the project, and it is hard to find a project you may be particularly passionate about. That is the biggest challenge.</p>\n<p>It is crucial that you work on a project you are passionate about because if you are not excited about your project and you can't get excited about it yourself nobody else will and it will end up just becoming another one of those project folders sitting on your computer collecting dust.</p>\n<p>Passion can come and go during the making of a project. You can have passion in the begginging but then you can loose that initial excitement you once had at the start of the project and that is the hardest part. <strong>Being passionate about a project, staying passionate about it during the duration of working on it, and being excited about it</strong> </p>\n<h4>#2 You need to be motivated about the project</h4>\n<p>You need to be motivated about the project and to finish it. If you can motivate yourself to finish a project whether that is to, make an app, start a blog then you have a much better chance of finishing whatever you started. However this point ties into being passionate. If you are not passionate about the project you won't be able to motivate yourself in the first place to work on the project.</p>\n<p><strong>Once you find an idea or start a small side project that you enjoy working on, a project you find value in, a project you are passionate about, you are much more likely to finish it as you will be able to motivate yourself. Whether that is an app you hope to sometime change the world or a side project that will get you a little bit of expierence.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Speaking of finishing projects, I personally started this blog page around July 2018, and I want to get back into it and write more posts that I think other programmers can relate to. I am going to try to stay motivated and passionate and write a blog post every week or so. </p>",frontmatter:{date:"December 16, 2018",path:"/how-to-not-abandon-your-side-projects",title:"How To Not Abandon Your Side Projects"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
