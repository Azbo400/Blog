Hello Everyone! This is my first blog post I am making, and I hope for it to be the first of many to come as I am going to make it one of my goals to blog my programming expierences with things such as Web Development, freelancing, Wordpress, Machine learning, etc. I am hoping to use blogging as a platform to gain an audience and a following for future projects to come and I hope many of you will find my posts insightful, and covering a wide range of topics. In terms of the website there is still a lot more to come with future updates to the site in mind, and I hope to blog weekly. 

Be sure to follow all my social media accounts for updates and more!
